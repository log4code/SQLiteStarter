# SQLite starter project

This project is specifically intended for use with [repl.it](https://repl.it). It allows you to download and use whatever version of sqlite3 that you wish, without having to worry about what is installed on a REPL.

## Usage

1. Start a new `bash` REPL on [repl.it](https://repl.it) and import this project from GitHub: https://github.com/log4code/SQLiteStarter.git

2. Run setup.sh
```
sh ./setup.sh
```

3. Alias the downloaded sqlite3 command line tools
```
source ./.bashrc
```
